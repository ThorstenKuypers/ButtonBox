USBDeviceController (USB-driver): Handles the access to the hardware and the registers. It also provides 
				  endpoints which function as input/outbut buffers for the device. Data written
to IN endpoints is sent to the host, data received from the host is put into OUT endpoints and can be read
from the USB device.

USBDevice: Represents the device itself. It consists of interfaces that represent functional units (functions) of a device.
